# Homework-3-PasswordGenerator
  The objective of this project was to create a website using Javascript that could randomly generate a password with or without the use of numbers, special characters, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters. 
  
##What was done in the homework--3
  I created a function within the website name to link to the generate passwrod button. Once this button was selected I coded the website to prompt a a series of questions  determine the number of character and whether or not to include numbers, special characters, lowercase characters, and uppercase characters. For the number of characters, the user would be prompted to put between 8 and 128 characters. If the user did not input a number within that range then they would be prompted to do so.
